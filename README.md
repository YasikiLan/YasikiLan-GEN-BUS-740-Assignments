**Assignment 1**: The assignment involves analyzing sales and pricing data to verify a claim by Steve, an analyst, that increasing prices by $1 leads to a 45-unit increase in sales. This includes running regression analyses, identifying possible confounding factors, and assessing their effects on the results to provide a recommendation on pricing policy.

**Assignment 2**: The assignment involves analyzing experimental data to evaluate the validity of randomization, calculate treatment means and average treatment effects (ATEs) with confidence intervals, and interpret the business implications of the findings. Additionally, the task requires identifying potential issues in the experiment's design, metrics, or results.

**Assignment 3**: The assignment involves analyzing an online marketing experiment to assess the overall effectiveness of ads, including checking for balance, estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), performing subgroup analysis by deciles of impressions, calculating the return on advertising, and evaluating the value of targeted advertising. The goal is to determine if the marketing was cost-effective and whether better targeting could improve ROI.

**Assignment 4**: The assignment involves analyzing headline click-through rate data from Upworthy experiments to determine if a question mark in a headline increases engagement. Tasks include calculating sample size and power, estimating the overall and average treatment effects (ATEs), and evaluating the reliability of focusing on significant results, followed by developing a hypothesis and pre-analysis plan for future experiments.

**Assignment 5**: The assignment involves analyzing a Trip.com experiment on the effects of hybrid work-from-home (HWFH) policies on employee quit rates and performance. Tasks include assessing the validity of the experiment, estimating the effects on outcomes (with confidence intervals), addressing concerns about excludability and differential attrition, summarizing findings and recommendations, and using Lee bounds to construct bounds on the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect for performance.

**Assignment 6**: The assignment has two parts: (1) analyzing the effect of TripAdvisor's rating system change on overall ratings compared to Yelp using statistical methods and visualizations, and (2) conducting a regression discontinuity analysis (RDD) on NYC taxi ride data to estimate the effect of default tip suggestions on tipping behavior and recommending an optimal tip default strategy for taxi companies.
